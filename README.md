# Deconvolution_via_stochastic_rotation
Codes to implement the method, proposed in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947323000178. The DeStoR_Rev.R is the main function to fit the proposed method. Here fitDeStoR.R is the application function that describes the steps to apply DeStoR function on the attached Synthetic data.
